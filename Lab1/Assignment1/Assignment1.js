// Question 1: Write a Node.js program that displays two separate messages in the console:
// ● "Hello, this is my first Node.js program!"
// ● "I am excited to learn more about Node.js!"
// Then, modify the program to concatenate these two messages into a single line and display:
// "Hello, this is my first Node.js program! I am excited to learn more about Node.js!"

console.log("Hello, this is my first Node.js program!");
console.log("I am excited to learn more about Node.js!");
var str1 = "Hello, this is my first Node.js program!";
var str2 = "I am excited to learn more about Node.js!";
console.log("\nAfter concatenate");
console.log(str1+" "+str2);
